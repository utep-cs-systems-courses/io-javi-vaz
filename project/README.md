## MINI PIANO

This program turns the MSP 430 into a piano that plays 4 notes depending on
the button pressed. The first button is for C, the second for D, the third for
E, and the fourth for F.

Additionally, the LEDS count each second to provide a tempo. The pattern goes
from 0 to 3 displaying the number in binary.

## HOW TO RUN

With the device connected, in the terminal run " make load " and after a
second the user should be able to play to their heart's content.
